# Creating a Document Fragment in JavaScript

This code snippet demonstrates how to use JavaScript to efficiently create a list of items and append them to an HTML container using a Document Fragment.


## Usage

To use this code:

1. Make sure you have an HTML file that includes an element with the ID "container" where you want to append the list of items.

2. Copy and paste the JavaScript code provided into a `<script>` tag or an external JavaScript file included in your HTML.

3. Load your HTML page in a web browser, and you should see the list of 1000 items added to the "container" element efficiently.

That's it! You've successfully created and appended a large number of elements to the DOM using a Document Fragment for improved performance.
